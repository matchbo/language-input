# MNIST: Historical Context and Our Approach

## Historical Context
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset emerged from early work at Bell Labs on automated check processing. Yann LeCun and his colleagues needed a way to reliably read handwritten digits on checks. Their work led to:
- Development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Creation of the LeNet architecture
- Standardization of the MNIST dataset as a benchmark

## Our Implementation Journey
We're exploring MNIST through multiple lenses:
1. Understanding the data through visualization
2. Implementing historical approaches (LeNet-style)
3. Applying modern PyTorch techniques

See the [implementation README](../experiments/mnist/README.md) for technical details.
